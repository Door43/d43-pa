  * Other ways to translate "believer" could be, "follower of Jesus" or, "people who know and obey Jesus."
  * The term "believer" is a general term for any believer in Christ, while "disciple" and "apostle" were used more specifically for people who knew Jesus while he was alive. It is best to translate these terms in different ways, in order to keep them distinct.
